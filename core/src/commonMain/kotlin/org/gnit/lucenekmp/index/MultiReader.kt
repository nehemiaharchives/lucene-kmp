/**
 * A [CompositeReader] which reads multiple indexes, appending their content. It can be used
 * to create a view on several sub-readers (like [DirectoryReader]) and execute searches on
 * it.
 *
 *
 * For efficiency, in this API documents are often referred to via *document numbers*,
 * non-negative integers which each name a unique document in the index. These document numbers are
 * ephemeral -- they may change as documents are added to and deleted from an index. Clients should
 * thus not rely on a given document having the same number between sessions.
 *
 *
 * <a id="thread-safety"></a>
 *
 *
 * **NOTE**: [IndexReader] instances are completely thread safe, meaning multiple
 * threads can call any of its methods, concurrently. If your application requires external
 * synchronization, you should **not** synchronize on the `IndexReader` instance; use
 * your own (non-Lucene) objects instead.
