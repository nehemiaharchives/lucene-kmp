/**
 * Reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to
 * provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.
 *
 *
 *  The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may be used.  The
 * default is large enough for most purposes.
 *
 *
 *  In general, each read request made of a Reader causes a corresponding
 * read request to be made of the underlying character or byte stream.  It is
 * therefore advisable to wrap a BufferedReader around any Reader whose read()
 * operations may be costly, such as FileReaders and InputStreamReaders.  For
 * example,
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * *     BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("foo.in"));
 * * }
 *
 * will buffer the input from the specified file.  Without buffering, each
 * invocation of read() or readLine() could cause bytes to be read from the
 * file, converted into characters, and then returned, which can be very
 * inefficient.
 *
 *
 *  Programs that use DataInputStreams for textual input can be localized by
 * replacing each DataInputStream with an appropriate BufferedReader.

     *  *  The `ready` method of the underlying stream
     * returns `false`, indicating that further input requests

     * If the first `read` on the underlying stream returns
     * `-1` to indicate end-of-file then this method returns
     * `-1`.  Otherwise this method returns the number of characters
     * actually read.

     *  Subclasses of this class are encouraged, but not required, to
     * attempt to read as many characters as possible in the same fashion.
